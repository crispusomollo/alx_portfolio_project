# Book Club Reading Library (Backend Only)
This is my Webstack Specialization portfolio project for my ALX Software Engineering program.

## Introduction
In this project, which aims to enhance the book reading experience, I will tackle the challenges I face during the reading process and how I intend to address them through the development of an interactive app. The app will provide features such as scheduling, goal-setting, progress tracking, and book recommendations. Focus on it's backend development first with UI designs to follow.

This project seeks to bridge the gap between traditional reading practices and modern technological conveniences. The app will offer a user-friendly interface, making it accessible for users of all ages and technical proficiencies. Whether it’s tracking personal progress, discovering new books, or synchronizing reading schedules with fellow book club members, the app aims to become an essential companion for every reader’s journey.
