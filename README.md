# Book Club Reading Library (Backend Only)

## Introduction
This is my Webstack Specialization portfolio project for my ALX SE program.
In this project, which aims to enhance the book reading experience, I will tackle the challenges I faced during the reading process and how I plan to address them through the development of an interactive app. The app is intended to provide features such as scheduling, goal-setting, progress tracking, and book recommendations. Join meto learn more about how this app will revolutionize the way we read and engage with books. I will focus on it'sbackend first.
